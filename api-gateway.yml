# Define settings for Single-Sign-On with OAuth2; this means that we need to relay the OAuth token
# to the subsequent resources that are proxied by the Zuul api gateway.

# The home definition tells us to allow anonymous access (secure: false) to the static resources that
# are accessed through the Zuul proxy.

# Remaining properties are used by the OAuth2 SSO to determine where the authorization server is and
# what client crendentials to use to access that server.
